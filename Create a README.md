# Create a README

###### tags: `webaverse`

Nearly every successful open source project has something in common: a good README. The README is the most important and powerful file in the project. It's like the packaging on a product, the front page of a newspaper, or a professional resume in that most will pass it up if there's no README or if the current one doesn't convince them that it's worth their time.

> If people don’t know what your software does, then they won’t use it or contribute to it and they will most likely find something more clear and concise in the sea of open-source software. -- [Source: How to write an Awesome README](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-write-an-awesome-readme-68bf4be91f8b)

The main mission right now for Webaverse MMO is to provide every project repo with a quality README file. It should help artists and devs understand each project, how they can get it working, and why they should contribute. Below are example templates we can use as guidelines:

- [Best README Template](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template) - Use `BLANK_README.md` to start
- [Awesome README](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/awesome-readme) - guide to writing an Awesome README
- [Awesome Repository](https://github.com/decentraland-scenes/Awesome-Repository#examples) - Inspired the README template below
    - Fork this HackMD: https://hackmd.io/@XR/readme-template/edit

It's not a bad idea to create the README first in HackMD so you can get quick feedback and fast collaboration. Both GitHub and HackMD use markdown.

:::info
It's good to include a feature list. Helps with SEO + if there's an interesting feature that a modder or artist would like to reimagine you can describe it in more detail. Example below pulled from [decentraland-scenes](https://github.com/decentraland-scenes/Awesome-Repository#examples).
