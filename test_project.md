# Test a Project

###### tags: `webaverse`

> Note: **MUST** have a local instance setup before testing, if you don't then see this guide first: https://hackmd.io/@metamike/local-scene-webaverse

Once you have your local instance setup and running you'll be ready to test the many types of interactive objects people make. Download a project from the [**Webaverse MMO**](https://github.com/webaverse-mmo) organization you wish to test first. I recommend using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) if you're a beginner at git.

Be sure to select the second option for *contributing to webaverse-mmo* when you clone the repo.

To test, simply drag n' drop the folder itself into the Webaverse browser window and equip or drop it then walk up to it and hold `e` to interact that way. It's that easy!

If you want to save the scene you can hit `ctrl-s` to export a scene.json with your current changes.

## Reporting Bugs

It's recommended to first get a second opinion / confirmation if you run into any issues. Lets say it's not related to documentation or templates, then you should report any such bugs to the main branch issue tracker to make it easier for devs to see.

- https://github.com/webaverse - Report bugs related to engine / animation
- https://github.com/webaverse-mmo - Issues related to docs / templates only

> Note: Don't worry too much about making a mistake, as long as there's documentation on the issue someone will get it to the right person to fix

Be detailed, provide any screenshots and relevant info such as what browser / OS you're using to give as much context to devs in order to reproduce and solve. Thank you!
